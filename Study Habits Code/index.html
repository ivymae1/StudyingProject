    <p>	Study habits can make or break how well a student does in class.  College is a different ballpark than high school, and discovering what habits and skills work for you can be difficult. Initially, my research focused on how students are handling large lecture classes, as these are usually what students say gives them the most trouble. We interviewed 3 different students from various majors and with very different personalities. From these interviews, one of the consistencies was that all three agreed a smaller, intimate classroom setting was more beneficial for their learning. Their reasoning behind this was that they had more access to teacher’s help, they could freely ask questions, and they could actually get to know your peers. All of those things are hard to get in a lecture hall. Another answer that all three students agreed on was that having a friend, or just being able to talk over concepts with a peer can immensely help how well you do in a class. These answers were consistent with the research I conducted when writing my paper. Most sources agree that smaller classes are more beneficial for learning, focus and creating a comfortable space where students aren’t afraid to share their ideas. Smaller classes are typical in high school, but if you attend a public college the majority of courses are large lecture style. This makes sense as it saves the school money and can teach hundreds of students at a time, but it doesn’t benefit the student. One way to make these classes better is to form study groups with your peers. Research showed that despite previous grades/ learning abilities, those who participated in outside study groups did significantly better in that class than those who did not. On top of this, forming an outside group can give students a small classroom feel, and help form friendships and connections outside of the classroom. Colleges incorporating easy ways to find study groups and give Freshman the resources needed to acclimate to hard college classes could greatly benefit the success rate and happiness of students.</p>

        <h6> What is your favorite place to study on campus? </h6>
    <p>
AH - Probably the studio, our entire class is usually there so i feel like i have a good support and motivation system
A - Hill library. I usually rent a study room or go to the quiet rooms and no one bothers me and I can do my own thing.
G - Hill. Because there are plenty of places to study, I can meet with teams, study groups, anybody I’d like to
</p>
 <h6>What type of resources do you use when studying?</h6>
<p>
    AH - resources that are usually on the moodle pages of the classes I’m in
A - Ill pull out my laptop and normally have the books with me or power points from class
G - I use the textbook or the class notes provided

Do you study alone or with other people?
AH- Usually with people. The reason I do that is because I think i get bored by myself and when I’m with other people i feel like i can go longer and collaborate
G- Depends on the class. If it’s something I can grasp easily then I’ll study alone but if i have questions ill study with other people
   </p>     
<h6>
    Have you taken a large lecture class and what was that like? </h6>
<p>AH - I did design thinking last year. Honestly i don’t think anyone paid attention because the class was too big. I think my smaller classes are more intuitive and it forces people to stay on top of things
            </p>

  </div>
  <div class="w3-col s4 w3-padding-large w3-opacity">
    
A - I did and it was hard to pay attention for the most part. I like the more intimate classes because then i feel like i can participate but the big classes intimidate me
        
<h6>What kinds of interactions did people have in these classes?</h6>
         A - Mainly the kids up front are the ones who talk in class and if the teacher were to assign a group project or talk to the person next to you people are just like eh
G - Most of the time it was just a lecture where we sat still and took notes. Sometimes there were portions where she would ask Tophat questions and we could discuss with our group. 

<h6>Do you use the textbook?</h6>
<p>AH - Yeah I’ve had a few classes require a textbook and i usually don’t even buy them or use them
A - If i get a physical textbook I don’t use it for the most part, I like the online textbooks better
G - Depends on the class, depends on how useful the textbook is, but i prefer the hard copy cause i don’t like flipping through the pages on a computer
      </p>
      <h6>Have you ever made a buddy in large classes?</h6>
<p>AH - last year when i took physics i didn’t really know anyone in my class cause it was outside the design college and it was a larger lecture class so i never really knew one in the class but I knew people who had taken the course and sort of collaborated with those people
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="w3-col s4  w3-padding-large w3-opacity">
    <p>
A - Actually i have yeah. People who i had the same major with, we had similar classes and just sort of became friends that way
G - Absolutely. Usually the first day i would just sit down next to people who looked like they were willing to talk and i kind of got to know them, ask questions about themselves and kind of got to know them that way.
</p>
      <h6>Do you attend study groups?</h6>
      <p>
A - No, no one in my classes have gotten a group together to study, i don’t know it must have just been the classes I’m in
G - Yeah id get in a group message with some people I met in class and just make a plan before , a week or so before a test when everyone could meet
</p>
      <h6>Do you think having a friend would help you succeed in a class?</h6>
<p>AH - It probably would have been helpful if i tried to get a study group outside of class 
A - Yeah i think so for sure. Just being able to talk over concepts with people I’m comfortable with and they know what they’re talking about makes studying better
G - Its easier to reach out if you have any questions, you don’t have to reach out to any teachers or TA you can just reach out to your friend and maybe they know the answer.

        <p>Making study groups and following through with them can be one of the most affective ways to learn and retain information.  Study groups can be a good form of motivation and support. Talking over concepts with students in the same situation as you can help you take in and retain concepts that might otherwise be hard to understand. </p>

        <p>Taking good notes in class helps students engage with what their teacher is showing and helps you make connections between topics. Creating mind maps with topics and subtopics helps many students. Other methods, such as creating charts to map out main takeaways are a good way to stay focused and recall information. Although this is not suggested for all students, some find that recording the class lectures and listening back later is the best way to remember important information. Handwriting notes instead of typing is known to help recall information, as it helps with comprehension and retention of information</p>

        <p>Procrastinating is one of the easiest ways to fall behind in class. Avoid falling into this cycle by writing everything down the day it’s due, and making sure to check your calendar regularly. Setting breaks for yourself can help you accomplish attainable goals, and makes the task seem less daunting. Try breaking the task into chunks so the work load is easier, and reward yourself for finishing. </p>

        Studies show that there is a clear and direct link between difficult classes and stress. For many college students, it is easy to fall in an academic trap of doing bad on a test or assignment, leading to feelings of discouragement, making their motivation fall quickly. This sort of pattern is what causes so many freshman to drop out of college early on, as they may feel discouraged from those first bad grades. Academic stress can turn into depression or anxiety, where students think they aren’t good enough, and may just give up entirely. With the right support, these cycles can be tackled and academics can become easier to handle.

          <p> 
        Being a freshman in college can be a jarring transition. Going from having little responsibilities, to having total freedom over what you can do with your life can be intimidating. Having giant class sizes with little teacher-student interaction can also be scary at first. Some colleges have transition programs that help freshman to get their footing and find their place at their university. These kinds of programs are helpful to give students a sense of community and motivation in a completely new place. 
      </p> 
          <p> 
        Being in large college classroom setting makes it hard for students to make friends or study partners. A lot of the responsibility is placed on the student to complete their work on time, keep up with assignments, and figure out how to study. Large classes don’t encourage interaction, but reaching out and starting up a study group can make a large class feel much smaller and intimate. Finding people that you can discuss concepts with gives many students the support they need to do well in their class.
